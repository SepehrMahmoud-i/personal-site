# My personal site
this site is open source like my MIND.

This is first edit of this file in Github.com

I'm just learning github.

This line is added to understand how GIT PULL works and how we can make pull easier(NOT fetch and merge)

I promise this is really for understanig git pull command

this line added when i created a branch in local space.
